abstract: "In this paper, we address the distributed average consensus problem over directed networks in open multi-agent systems (OMAS), where the stability of the network is disrupted by frequent agent arrivals and departures, leading to a time-varying average consensus target. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel ratio consensus algorithm OPENRC based on acknowledgement feedback, designed to be robust to agent arrivals and departures, as well as to unbalanced directed network topologies. We demonstrate that when all active agents execute the OPENRC algorithm, the sum of their state variables remains constant during quiescent epochs when the network remains unchanged. By assuming eventual convergence during such quiescent periods following persistent variations in system composition and size, we prove the convergence of the OPENRC algorithm using column-stochasticity and sum-preservation properties. Finally, we apply and evaluate our proposed algorithm in a simulated environment, where agents are departing from and arriving in the network to highlight its resilience against changes in the network size and topology."
