I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy/?languageId=1) in June 2017, and my M.Sc. degree in Autonomous Systems from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) and [Aalto University](https://www.aaltoa.fi/fi) holding an excellence scholarship from [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/). During my postgraduate (M.Sc.) studies, I worked as a Research Assistant at Aalto University and Research Engineer Fellow at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Towards the end of my postgraduate studies, I joined [Ericsson AB](https://www.ericsson.com/en) to pursue my M.Sc. thesis entitled ["Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management in 5G-NR Networks"](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1527910). I am currently a doctoral (Ph.D) student working on distributed optimization for decision and control of networked systems, at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the [University of Cyprus](https://ucy.ac.cy/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Themistoklis Charalambous](https://themistoklis.org/).

My research interests focus on distributed optimization for decision and control of networked systems, with applications in quadrotor navigation, resource management, and wireless link adaptation and scheduling.
