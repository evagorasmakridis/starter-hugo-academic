Evagoras Makridis received his B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy/?languageId=1) in June 2017, and his M.Sc. degree in Autonomous Systems from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) and [Aalto University](https://www.aaltoa.fi/fi) holding an excellence scholarship from [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/). Following his undergraduate studies, he worked as a Full Stack Engineer at [TRG Research and Development](https://www.trgint.com/) in the telecommunications domain. During his postgraduate (M.Sc.) studies, he worked as a Research Assistant at Aalto University and Research Engineer Fellow at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Towards the end of his postgraduate studies, he joined [Ericsson AB](https://www.ericsson.com/en) to pursue his M.Sc. thesis entitled “Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management in 5G-NR Networks”. Since February 2021, he works as a Researcher for Horizon 2020 European projects in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) domain at [Suite5 Data Intelligence](https://www.suite5.eu/). Evagoras has been recently accepted for pursuing his doctoral (Ph.D) studies in Electrical Engineering at the [University of Cyprus](https://ucy.ac.cy/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Themistoklis Charalambous](https://themistoklis.org/), and focusing on distributed decision and control of networked systems.

Throughout his research, he published one journal and two conference papers in peer reviewed IEEE venues in the area of automation and control, wireless communications, and services computing. His research interests focus on estimation and control for autonomous systems, sequential decision-making and reinforcement learning (RL) for automated resource management in distributed and networked systems.
