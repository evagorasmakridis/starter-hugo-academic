The EDEM project aims to develop a distributed framework to coordinate renewable energy resources, storage, and electric vehicles despite unstable communication and computational constraints. By enabling resilient peer-to-peer data exchange and dynamic bidding strategies, it aims to improve grid reliability and increase energy savings for local communities. A simulation suite and prototype will validate the approach using real operational data under varying grid and market conditions.
