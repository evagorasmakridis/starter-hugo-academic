Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as renewable energy sources (RES), electricity storage systems (ESS), and electric vehicles (EVs), offers promising avenues for enhancing the sustainability of energy networks, yet poses several challenges in efficient resource management. Coordinating these diverse resources in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner via communication networks is essential for dynamically adjusting bidding strategies in energy markets, ensuring the fulfillment of both individual and network-wide objectives. However, the uncertain and varying power generation/demand of DERs as well as the communication and computation barriers, constitute some of the significant challenges that negatively affect the reliability of the power grid and prevent energy savings of individual entities. To address these challenges, the proposed EDEM solution focuses on developing resilient distributed algorithms facilitating reliable peer-to-peer data exchange among DERs to enhance both grid reliability and increase the energy savings of individual communities. Within this framework, all data from energy resources become accessible to cooperative edge computing nodes aiming towards a more inclusive and democratized energy network. The provision of coordinated bidding strategy adjustment that the EDEM solution provides will maximize the overall network resource utilization and ensure its resilient operation. We aim to deliver a Simulation Suite and a prototype small-scale implementation of the proposed framework, along with an extensive realistic evaluation based on RES generation predictions from real DERs data managed by the host organization. The evaluation will involve addressing industrial use cases, including real-time balancing of electricity supply and demand under different energy market scenarios and operational states of the grid. Through these efforts, the EDEM project seeks to pave the way for a more resilient and sustainable energy ecosystem.
